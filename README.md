# mindustry-mod-sprites
this is a collection of sprite templates for modification to suite your mod feel free to add more to expand the sprite library.
mark the one in use in your mod if you add those.do not use a straight template modify it before final release. 
no more OH No
mark by a watermark or via file name ie.<mod name> sprite name.png
if it is in use in a released mod you must change the shape in a considrable way not just a rgb shift.
if you do use a template ether do the same as with what is in use
if you feel you must use the base template give credit and ask 
you can use in use sprites however ask mod aothur for permission and give cedit
